    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>My name is Joshua Paul Coppen, I am a 27-year-old man from Adelaide. I have been married for five years and have two beautiful children. I was born in Adelaide,
       although both my parents were born in England, so I have a bit of love for the poms. During high school, my goal was to get an electrical apprenticeship, due to
        this I left school after year 11. Unfortunately, I never got an apprenticeship and instead worked in retail management for over ten years. English is the only
         language I currently know but with my time at RMIT I hope to learn a thing or two about programming languages such as java. American football has interested me
          greatly over the past 6 months with my team The New England Patriots winning the Superbowl, but Aussie Rules is still my favorite and the season is just about
           to kick off. </p>

   <h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
   <p>On my fifth birthday my parents bought me a Nintendo Entertainment System. It was my first real interaction with information technology I remember having. I loved that
      console so much that gaming is still one of my primary hobbies. Playing games on consoles in my childhood years I decided I wanted to build my own computer to play titles
       such as World of Warcraft and Counter Strike. With my friends help, we built my first computer and I have built a further two since. Now I want to learn more about the
        inner workings of computers such as programming, networking and databased systems. I want to make a career out of what I learn here.</p>
  <p>With a mortgage to pay for and a family to look after flexibility was the biggest concern I had going in to study. Currently my wife is on unpaid maternity leave and I have
     ceased from working so money is tight. Eventually she will go back to work (hopefully September) and I will be looking after the kids. Because of this, studying online makes
      sense. Looking at the degrees OUA had to offer, RMIT had the best all-round IT degree in my opinion. Pairing this with the reputation RMIT have made choosing them easier.</p>
  <p>After I have finished my studies, I expect to be equipped with the skills necessary to make a meaningful impact on the employer that decides to hire me. I would expect to know
     a great deal about programming, managing networks, and creating applications. Although every job is different to some degree, I would expect to able to perform the tasks
      necessary (IT related of course) that my employer asks of me from the beginning of my employment.</p>

  <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
    <img src="job.jpg">
    <p><em>Figure 1 Job Advertisement - (SEEK, 2019)</em></p>

    <p>A senior software engineer generally has a strong background in web development. To be successful as a software engineer you need to know HTML, CSS, JavaScript extensively.
       They must know how to effectively lead a team, in this case, from home.</p>
    <p>Ever since I left school to start work, I have always had a dream to work at home and with programming that might be a reality someday. Programming was the key driver for
       me to start studying here at RMIT, so to have both of those things appeals to me. Senior software engineer is the position of the job and it doesn’t go into much details
        of the projects that the job seeker will be working on.</p>
    <p>The most important trait that Oscar Thomas Group are looking for is experience with at least 5 years .NET experience which includes languages such as; C#, C++, Visual Basic
       .NET, and others. The applicant will need to know their way around the AngularJS web framework, Elasticsearch and SQL. They will adhere to the principles of continuous
        integration, continuous delivery and Agile software development. They will also have cloud experience such as knowledge of the google cloud platform. Although no formal
         qualifications are asked for, a degree from a university would be preferred.</p>
    <p>Currently I have none of the skills, qualifications or experience to be able to successfully apply for this job. I am only starting to learn programming this study
       period in introduction to programming.  I would struggle to even explain a lot of the other requirements for the role.</p>
    <p>I plan on completing a Bachelor of Information Technology which I believe should equip me for the workforce. I would also like to take lessons on websites such as
       Khan Academy to help me prepare for the workforce and gain extra skills I do not currently have. I know this is not an entry level job for graduates but it is
        something to aim for later in life so I can have manageable work life balance.</p>

    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>

    <p><b>Myers-Briggs test</b> (16Personalities, 2019)</p>
    <p>Personality type – Protagonist (ENFJ-T)</p>
    <p><em>With vision and determination, nothing is impossible.</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mind - 64% extraverted – 36% introverted</li>
      <li>Energy - 55% intuitive – 45% observant</li>
      <li>Nature – 31% thinking – 69% feeling</li>
      <li>Tactics – 61% judging – 39% prospecting</li>
      <li>Identity – 44% assertive – 56% turbulent</li>
    </ul>

   <p><b>Learning style test </b> (Educationplanner.org, 2019)</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Auditory: 45%</li>
     <li>Visual: 30%</li>
     <li>Tactile: 25%</li>
  </ul>
   <p><b>Test of our choosing  </b> (Aptitude-test.com, 2019)</p>
   <p>40 questions total</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Correct answers – 34</li>
     <li>Wrong answers – 6</li>
     <li>Time used – 11:08</li>
     <li>Time left – 3:52</li>
    <li>Time per question: 17 seconds</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Total score percentage: 85%</p>
   <p>Score by sub-test</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Verbal ability: 83%</li>
     <li>Non-verbal ability: 80%</li>
     <li>Numerical ability: 92%</li>
   </ul>

   <p>For the most part I believe the tests told me what I already knew about myself. The results of the Myers-Briggs Test describe me as a leader. I agree with this result as
      I was a team leader in my previous role. One aspect about myself which I should try to focus my attention on is my nature. The results say I let my emotions get the
       better of me, which leads me to quickly jump to conclusions rather than rationally think a situation through. The learning styles test indicated that I am an auditory
        learner which means I learn best by listening.  In the aptitude test I scored strongly all round, numerical ability being my strongest skill.</p>
  <p>I believe these results will help me in a team environment. Being more of an extrovert I should be able to communicate with a team effectively. The results of the Myer-Briggs
     test tell us that protagonists like me are keen to see teams work together and are able to communicate their opinions (16Personalities, 2019).</p>
  <p>When forming a team, it would be best to have a balance of different personality types in order to achieve success. A team full of extraverted leaders would end up with no
     one able to communicate effectively with one another, only listening to their own voice and ideas. </p>

  <h2>Project Idea – What to Watch on the Box</h2>
  <p>For as long as there have been smartphones, I have always wanted to create my own application for them. I have always loved brainstorming ideas with my wife and friends.
     One idea I came up with is an application to help couples choose what to watch in their spare time together (TV, Netflix, stan etc). The idea is based off the successful
      dating app Tinder where users swipe right (interested) or left (not interested) on people’s photos to create matches with each other. I would be taking the same concepts
       and applying that to movies and tv shows.</p>
  <p>Sitting on the couch at home with my wife we often take so long to choose a specific program to watch, that most of the night is gone hopelessly searching through content.
     If this application was made couples could jump on to the application at any extra time throughout the day, such as on the train on the way to work, and swipe away at content
      they do and do not want to watch. When a match is found it will notify both parties and hopefully, they will save time knowing what they are going to watch tonight.</p>
  <p>Upon downloading and opening What to Watch on the Box (until better name comes to mind) users will be given a code, which they will share with their partner. They will then
     be asked to place in their partners code, which will pair their devices. Users will then set up filters based on answering questions on their viewing interests. People will
      then be asked what media services that they have available at home (such as free to air, Netflix, Amazon prime Video etc).</p>
  <p>After all these questions users will then be directed to the menu. The menu will have a list of options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TV</li>
    <li>Movies</li>
    <li>Your Interested list</li>
    <li>Their Interested list</li>
    <li>Matches</li>
    <li>Options</li>
    <li>Exit</li>
</ul>
  <p>If people choose either TV or movies, a tile with a TV or movie title will appear based off the filters they chose before between them and their partner. The tile will have
     a picture of the movie in the background. It will also have a synopsis, a link to a trailer, what platform they can view it on, content rating and a star rating. Individuals
      would then simply swipe left or swipe right. If people swipe left it would be discarded as not interested. If they swipe right, it would be added to their interested list
       and could potentially be added to their match list with their partner. These lists would be viewable at any time through the menu. Both people can see each other’s interested
        lists. When a match is made, it will send a notification to the other user suggesting they could watch that movie together.</p>
  <p>In the options menu, users would be able to change up what media service they have access to or what genres they would like to look at. When a user does change a genre or
     media service a notification would be sent to the paired other to let them know of the changes. </p>
  <p>In the options of What to Watch on the Box there will also be a children friendly profile. Parents could use alone to decide what is acceptable for their child/children to
     view. With worries about what kids can view on websites like Youtube, it could help make more informed choices. A parent would do the swiping, and it would not need a paired
      person to make a match.</p>
  <p>The service would be free to download from both the google play store and apple app store. The would-be advertisements on every tenth swipe left (subject to change). The
     advertisements would either be a video or a picture with a timer as seen on most free applications. There will also be a paid option for the app set at around $5 AUD.</p>
  <p>To make this application I believe I will need to be proficient in at least one major programming language. From there making use of a cross platform development network such
     as Ionic or NativeScript which would allow the code from a single language to work on say both Android and iOS. What to watch on the box will need access to all the movie and
      TV titles that each streaming service provides. </p>
  <p>As I am new to programming and everything in depth information technology wise, I would have to learn a whole range of skills. I would have to learn a whole programming language
     so that I would be able to write the application. Communication skills will be necessary as I am not sure if I will need permission to use the data from the streaming services.
      Through my studies here at RMIT I believe I will know how to start making this app. In the meantime, I will complete tutorials on web applications such as Khan Academy. </p>
  <p>What to Watch on the Box would be a helpful tool designed to streamline couple’s entertainment choices, and potentially help parents make better judgements about what their kids
     can watch. In today’s day and age with multiple income homes, spending time together isn’t always the easiest thing to do. When time is available couples don’t want to waste it
      bickering about what to watch. The application will be easy tof use in wasted time (public transport, lunch breaks at work) so when people come together at home the choices will
       already be made. Developing this application will help couples enjoy their down time together. </p>
